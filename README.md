# TTVInversion
Nesvorný et al. (2013): "Inversion of TTV Data to Infer Planetary Parameters.
The paper describes a matrix-based approach to invert Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) to infer planetary masses and orbital parameters. Key points from the paper:

TTV Basics: TTVs are deviations in the transit times of a planet due to gravitational interactions with other planets in the system.

Matrix Formulation: The TTVs are expressed as a linear system of equations, where the observed TTVs are related to the planetary masses and orbital parameters via a design matrix.

Inversion: The system is solved using linear algebra techniques to infer the planetary parameters.
